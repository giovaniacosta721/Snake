A Pokemon themed Snake.

  This is a Pokemon themed Snake game written in Java. The sprites are made to look like the pokemon on the right-hand side of the program,
each providing different things to the player. Collecting the Pikachu sprites provide a standard point to the total score, the Charmander
sprites lock movement for 5 movement button presses, the Bulbasaur sprite increases movement speed (an ability that stacks), and the
Squirtle sprite removes a player life.

  Score values, the name of the players who achieved them, and the dates they were achieved are stored in a local file. Enjoy!
